# CS140Project1
Please see the attached instructions for Project 1.  This is a team project.  It is due by 6 pm on Sunday, October 9.

Canvas has now placed each of you into a team of two students; you can see the team listings for Projects 1 and 2 by clicking on the "People" link on the left-hand side of the screen, then selecting "Groups" (see the attached screenshot below).   In order to minimize issues with sections in which enrollment is an odd number, I've allowed Canvas to assign teams across section boundaries.  Please reach out to your teammate by email or through Canvas as soon as possible to begin discussing and planning out your work for the project.

When your team has finished the program (as described in the attached document), you should submit it to Canvas.  As always, please submit your actual source code file (it is the one that ends in .cpp).

As described in the instructions, I'm also attaching a generateRandomKey() function that you may use.
